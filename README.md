# Mi Body Composition Scale 2 Garmin Connect

## 1. Introduction

This project is based on the following projects:

https://github.com/rando-calrissian/esp32_xiaomi_mi_2_hass

https://github.com/lolouk44/xiaomi_mi_scale

https://github.com/davidkroell/bodycomposition

It allows the Mi Body Composition Scale 2 to be fully automatic synchronized to Garmin Connect.

## 2. How does this work?

 - after weighing, Mi Body Composition Scale 2 is active for 15 minutes on bluetooth transmission;

 - the ESP32 module every 5 minutes (deep sleep is used) queries scale for data, the process can be started immediately via the reset button;

 - the ESP32 module sends the acquired data via the MQTT protocol to the MQTT broker installed on the server;

 - the body weight and impedance data on the server are appropriately processed by scripts;

 - the processed data are sent by the program body composition to Garmin Connect;

 - raw data from the scale is backed up on the server.
